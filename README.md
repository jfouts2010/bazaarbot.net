# bazaarbot.net

This is my attempt to impliment the bazaarbot from the paper [Emergent Economies for Role Playing Games](http://ianparberry.com/pubs/econ.pdf). My implimentation ended up with the bots having volatile pricing which I was not happy with. I'm working on redoing this project using beta distribution for their price estimates and will link here when the github for that is up.
